### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Component behavior and logic testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: API integration and data flow testing
- **Visual Tests**: Baseball diamond component rendering and runner positioning
- **Snapshot Tests**: Component output consistency verification

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack Choices
- **Vite + React + TypeScript**: Fast development with type safety
- **Material-UI**: Professional components with accessible design out of box
- **RTK Query**: Data fetching with automatic caching and real-time updates
- **MLB Stats API**: Official MLB data source for schedules and live game data
- **Jest + React Testing Library**: Comprehensive testing framework for reliability

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component structure**: Separated pages from reusable components
- **CSS Grid Layout**: Custom grid system for optimal information display
- **API integration**: RTK Query handles schedule and live game data with TypeScript interfaces
- **State management**: Redux store for API state, local React state for UI interactions
- **Baseball Diamond**: SVG-based component with CSS variables for dynamic runner positioning

### Key Features Implementation
- **Marlins.com UI**: Applied Marlins theme, font, colors
- **Real-time Schedule Data**: Displays all 11 Marlins affiliate teams across all league levels
- **Live Game Tracking**: Current inning, outs, active batter, and pitching information
- **Baseball Diamond Visualization**: Interactive SVG diamond showing runners on base with real-time updates
- **Game State Management**: Handles Preview, Live, Final, and No Game states
- **Date Navigation**: Calendar picker with refresh functionality
- **League Level Display**: Interactive popover showing team league information
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for code quality
